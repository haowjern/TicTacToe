# TicTacToe Program

Description:
- Implemented TicTacToe in C++ for human input. AI was implemented by assuming it plays randomly. 

Usage:
- Game is suitable to run on Microsoft Visual Studio using the console. 

Personal Note: 
- Starting off my C++ learning journey by programming games (while using a textbook)! It's a bit surprising to spend hours coding this seemingly simple game to implement gameplay flow and think off all the edge-cases while testing them. Coming from Python, I can't believe I took type-casting and finding for granted! 

- Tentatively, I think better code can be implemented as there is some brute force if/else statements to check for winning/losing and drawing conditions. In the future, I hope learning OOP will make the code look cleaner and easier to work with, as I think many of these game-play decisions can be made into objects to be easier displayed, e.g. check_winning_condition, play_ai etc.
